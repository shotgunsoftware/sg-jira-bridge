Known Issues & Compatibility Notes
##################################

Because Flow Production Tracking and Jira are both highly customizable and have different APIs,
there are some cases where things may not match up as expected. There are also
cases where certain features have not been implemented yet.

- Deletion events are not handled yet.

- Flow Production Tracking Jira Bridge does not create entities in Flow Production Tracking, it will only update
  existing ones. This means syncing can only *initiate* from Flow Production Tracking and not
  from Jira. If an entity in Flow Production Tracking that was synced with an issue in Jira is
  deleted, it will not currently be re-created in Flow Production Tracking.

- In most cases only one :class:`~sg_jira.handlers.SyncHandler` can handle a
  given event. The exception is with the **Sync In Jira** event which is a
  special case that is handled by the
  :class:`~sg_jira.handlers.EnableSyncingHandler` which is a container
  for multiple handlers.

- Notes in Flow Production Tracking can be linked to multiple entities, but Comments in Jira
  can only be linked to a single Issue. Notes linked to multiple entities in
  Flow Production Tracking will be synced in Jira but only linked to a single Issue. There is
  no logic to choosing which Issue the Note is linked to other than the first
  one that the Bridge encounters.

- Flow Production Tracking Notes contain a subject and content, while Jira Comments have only
  a body. When syncing Notes from Flow Production Tracking to Jira, a special formatting is
  used to mimic the structure that Flow Production Tracking uses. Updates to a Comment in Jira
  must retain this formatting otherwise the Comment will not sync back to
  Flow Production Tracking.

- Note Replies in Flow Production Tracking are not currently handled by Flow Production Tracking Jira Bridge. Jira
  has no concept of replies, or threading in Comments. This workflow is
  being investigated.

- Duplicating an Entity in Flow Production Tracking that is currently synced with Jira, will
  also duplicate the **Jira Key** field, possibly causing data corruption.
  We recommend not duplicating synced Entities in Flow Production Tracking. Alternatively, you
  may enable unique values on the **Jira Key** in Flow Production Tracking, however this will
  now generate an error in Flow Production Tracking if a synced Entity is duplicated. Perhaps
  it's better than possibly corrupting the synced Jira Issue.

- Jira single-line `Text Field` fields are limited to 255 characters. When
  syncing from Flow Production Tracking to Jira, if the Flow Production Tracking field is mapped to a Jira
  single-line Text Field, and the value is longer than 255 characters, a
  warning is logged, the synced value will be truncated and an addendum added
  that says to look in Flow Production Tracking for the full value. This could cause data loss
  if the field is then updated in Jira which will overwrite the original value
  in Flow Production Tracking.
