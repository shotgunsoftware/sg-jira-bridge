Overview
########
The ShotGrid Jira Bridge (``sg-jira-bridge``) provides a simple setup to sync
data between ShotGrid and Jira.

At the heart of the workflow is a  lightweight webapp that handles POST
requests to sync data. A request is validated and executed by this module
code which handles all of the connections, logic, and data translation
between ShotGrid and Jira. It then sends a request to update ShotGrid or
Jira with the translated data.

Requests to sync data from ShotGrid to Jira are generated by the
``sg_jira_event_trigger.py`` plugin running in the ShotGrid Event Daemon.
Requests to sync data from Jira to ShotGrid are generated by a web hook that
is configured  in Jira for your Project.
