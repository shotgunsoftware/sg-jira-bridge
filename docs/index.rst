Shotgun Jira Bridge
==========================================
The Shotgun Jira Bridge (``sg-jira-bridge``) provides a simple setup to sync
data between Shotgun and Jira.

.. image:: _static/sg_jira_bridge_workflow.png

At the heart of the workflow is a  lightweight webapp that handles POST requests
to sync data. A request is validated and executed by this module code which handles all of the
connections, logic, and data translation between Shotgun and Jira. It then sends
a request to update Shotgun or Jira with the translated data.

Requests to sync data from Shotgun to Jira are generated by the ``sg_jira_event_trigger.py``
plugin running in the Shotgun Event Daemon. Requests to sync data from Jira to Shotgun are
generated by a web hook that is configured  in Jira for your Project.

For more information about setting up the Shotgun Jira Bridge, see the
`README.md <https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/sg-jira-bridge>`_ in Github.
