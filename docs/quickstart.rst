Quick Start
###########
The instructions below will help you get up and running quickly.

Requirements
************
- Python 2.7
- A Shotgun site
- A Jira site


Getting the Code
****************
The quickest way to get the code required is by cloning the Github repos

- SG Jira Bridge: https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/sg-jira-bridge
- shotgunEvents: https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/shotgunEvents

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /path/to/put/this
    $ git clone git@github.com:shotgunsoftware/sg-jira-bridge.git
    $ git clone git@github.com:shotgunsoftware/shotgunEvents.git


A note about JIRA servers hosted by Atlassian
*********************************************

In April 2019, Atlassian put a new set of rules around accessing user data
due to the the European GDPR regulation. Since then, email addresses of JIRA
users are no longer accessible.

As the Shotgun JIRA bridge relies on this information to pair Shotgun users
with JIRA users, some extra steps will be required to configure the JIRA
bridge. This quickstart page will alert you when these extra steps are needed.


Setting up Shotgun
******************
Required Fields
===============
The following fields must be created in Shotgun for each of the
following entity types:

===========   ======================   =========   ==========================
Entity Type   Field Name               Data Type   Display Name (recommended)
===========   ======================   =========   ==========================

Setting Up Your Config and Env
******************************

There are two different pieces to setting up the Shotgun Jira Bridge. There's the bridge itself
(``sg-jira-bridge``), which handles all of the syncing of data between Shotgun and Jira. Then 
there's the Shotgun Event Daemon (``shotgunEvents``), which handles dispatching supported Shotgun 
events to the bridge.

Since they are installed in different locations and each setup has different python module 
requirements, the instructions below describe how to setup an environment for each of them 
separately. 

SG Jira Bridge
==============
Installing Required Modules
---------------------------
We recommend `setting up a virtual environment <https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/>`_.
Ensure you have `virtualenv <https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/>`_ installed in your global Python installation.
A ``requirements.txt`` file is provided to install all required packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    # create a virtualenv
    $ virtualenv venv

    # Activate the virtualenv
    # On MacOS/Linux:
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows (using PowerShell)
    $ venv/Scripts/activate

    # Install required packages
    pip install -r /path/to/sg-jira-bridge/requirements.txt

.. note::
    If you are upgrading from a previous version of the bridge, we recommend you re-install dependencies
    as we've had to fork the ``jira`` Python module to add a missing feature.


Settings
--------
Settings are defined in the ``settings.py`` file in the root of the repo. For the quickstart,
the default settings are fine as-is.

Authentication
--------------
Credentials are retrieved from environment variables. You may set these in your
environment or use `python-dotenv <https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv>`_ 
and define these in a ``.env`` file.

::

    # Shotgun credentials
    SGJIRA_SG_SITE='https://mysite.shotgunstudio.com'
    SGJIRA_SG_SCRIPT_NAME='sg-jira-bridge'
    SGJIRA_SG_SCRIPT_KEY='01234567@abcdef0123456789'  # replace with your api key

    # Jira credentials
    SGJIRA_JIRA_SITE='https://mystudio.atlassian.net'
    SGJIRA_JIRA_USER='richard.hendricks@piedpiper.com'
    SGJIRA_JIRA_USER_SECRET='youkn0wwh@tapa$5word1smAKeitag0odone3'  # replace with your user's password or API key

.. note::

    **Jira Cloud** requires the use of an API token and will not work with
    a user password. See https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/Vo71Nw for information 
    on how to generate a token.
    
    **Jira Server** will still work with a user password and does not support 
    API tokens.

    For more information, see: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-basic-authentication/ 

.. note::

    Since Jira does not have a concept of a "script" user, ``SGJIRA_JIRA_USER``
    will need to be the designated user account, with appropriate
    permissions, that will control the sync updates.


shotgunEvents
=============
Details for configuring the Shotgun Event Daemon are available on the
`shotgunEvents wiki <https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/shotgunEvents/wiki>`_

Installing Required Modules
---------------------------
We recommend `setting up a virtual environment <https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/>`_.
Ensure you have `virtualenv <https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/>`_ installed in your global Python installation.

.. code-block:: bash

    # create a virtualenv
    $ virtualenv venv

    # Activate the virtualenv
    # On MacOS/Linux:
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows (using PowerShell)
    $ venv/Scripts/activate

    # Install required packages for the trigger. 
    # Note: This requirements.txt is in the "sg-jira-bridge/triggers" 
    #       subdirectory, NOT in the root of the project.
    pip install -r /path/to/sg-jira-bridge/triggers/requirements.txt

Enable the SG Jira Trigger
--------------------------
Add the path to the SG Jira Bridge ``sg_jira_event_trigger.py`` file to the
shotgunEvents conf file::

    ...
    [plugins]
    # Plugin related settings

    # A comma delimited list of paths where the framework should look for plugins to
    # load.
    paths: /path/to/sg_jira_bridge/triggers, /path/to/any/other/shotgun/plugins
    ...

Authentication
--------------
The trigger uses the following environment variables to retrieve Shotgun
credentials::

    # sg_jira_event_trigger.py credentials
    SGDAEMON_SGJIRA_NAME='sg_jira_event_trigger'
    SGDAEMON_SGJIRA_KEY='01234567@abcdef0123456789'  # replace with your api key

.. note::

    The trigger uses it's own authentication to Shotgun, independent of the
    auth used in the SG Jira Bridge Server and the main shotgunEvents settings.
    We highly recommend you add an additional Script User in Shotgun solely
    for this trigger.



Starting Everything Up
**********************

Match Shotgun users with JIRA users (for JIRA servers hosted by Atlassian only)
===============================================================================

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python update_shotgun_users.py --settings <path to your settings.py> --project <id of your project>

.. note::
    For every user found in Shotgun, the script will search for a JIRA user with
    the same email address. If you have multiple users in Shotgun with
    the same email address, only the first one, i.e. the one with the lowest id,
    will be associated with a JIRA account.

    If you wish to change the Shotgun user associated with a JIRA account, e.g. the
    script associated the first Shotgun user with an account when you actually wanted
    the second one, you can take the account id from the ``HumanUser.sg_jira_account_id``
    field from one user and copy it to another user and then clear the original user's
    account id.

    If new users are added to JIRA and Shotgun, run this script again and the new user
    accounts will be paired. Existing pairings will be left as they were.

.. note::
    Due to JIRA API restrictions, we can only search for email addresses of users
    that can be assigned on issues for a given JIRA project. If all
    your JIRA users can access any JIRA project, the value for the ``--project``
    argument can be any project id. If you have restrictions, you will need to
    run this script once per project so that all your JIRA users can be discovered
    and paired with a Shotgun user.

Start SG Jira Bridge
====================
.. code-block:: bash

    $ python webapp.py --settings <path to your settings.py> --port 9090


Start shotgunEvents
===================

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./shotgunEventDaemon.py foreground

.. note::

    This starts the event daemon in foreground mode, logging everything to the
    terminal which is helpful for testing. When running in production, you'll
    start it with ``./shotgunEventDaemon.py start``

Testing It Out
**************
Once everything is running you're ready to test it!

- Create an Asset in Shotgun with a TaskTemplate appied.
- Toggle the **Sync In Jira** checkbox ``on`` for one of the Tasks.
- Navigate to your Jira site to see the Issue created for that Task.
- Change the status in Jira to see the status change in Shotgun.

If things don't seem to be working, check the output from SG Jira Bridge and
shotgunEvents in your terminal window for log messages.

.. note::
    For any synced entity, Shotgun stores the associated Jira key in the
    ``sg_jira_key`` field which will update automatically when you initially
    sync the Task. Jira stores the associated Shotgun Entity type and ID in
    the **Shotgun Type** and **Shotgun ID** fields as well as a link to the
    entity in Shotgun in the **Shotgun URL** field. This is a good indicator
    that things are working correctly.
