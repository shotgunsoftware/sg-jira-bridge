        # macOS & codecov note:
        # In Nov 2024 (SG-36700), we pinned macOS to codecov v0.7.3 because the
        # macOS-latest Azure Pipelines agent is Intel (x86_64), but Codecov started
        # shipping arm64-only binaries.
        # When we will change the macOs image to a arm64 arch, we can use the
        # "latest" version again.
